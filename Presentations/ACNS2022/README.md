The 2022 American Conference on Neutron Scattering was held in Boulder Colorado
from June 6 to June 9.  The concept of community software development for analysis
was presented with lessons learned.

ABSTRACT:
**Addressing the Resource Problem Through Community. SasView: An “Open, Collaborative, Community Development” Platform for Small Angle Scattering**

As the needs for advanced computational tools become increasingly critical for the extraction of new scientific knowledge from scattering data,
the need for increasingly sophisticated tools has become a bottleneck despite relatively large (compared to the past) investments in software and
the “cyberinfrastructure revolution.” Here we posit that this problem is not going away, fundamentally because analysis needs are, and will remain,
effectively infinite, while resources will always be finite, and suggest a potential path forward.

SasView is a SAS data analysis package that originated out of the NSF funded DANSE project and has evolved into an international collaborative effort
that is experimenting with ways of providing robust and sustainable analysis software in this new cyberaware age. In this presentation we will not
focus on the software and its features per se, but rather on how it is trying to deliver those features. We will start by defining the current scope
of SasView followed by a brief history of the project. We will present the variety of help/support/education and outreach resources and the development
infrastructures put together over time. We will take a particular look at how each word in “open, collaborative, community development” is currently 
addressed, and discuss how we got to where we are, the lessons learned along the way and the challenges faced, then and now.

Besides helping to optimize the use of limited resources by not ending up with excessive duplication, this type of community approach has the potential
of being a way to self select the areas of most important need on which to focus the finite resources. While this “experiment” remains a work in progress,
we propose that this model, no doubt with some adjustments, should at the very least be an important part of any holistic plan for providing scientific
software tools in the future, particularly for data emanating out of large scale facilities.
