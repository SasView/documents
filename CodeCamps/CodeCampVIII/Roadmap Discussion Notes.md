# Comments to RoadMap discussion at the Code Camp VII

## Infrastructure

- sascalc available from pypi (probably sascalc name is already taken by
  Sasie package)
- ESS/DMSC is deploying new VM setup as a part of 5.0 infrastructure, it
  will replace current Jenkins-based build system, which will be phasing
out with 4.x series
- SasView should be deployable on computer clusters. In the first run it can be run
  headless but in the long term goal it can also be configurable from
GUI.
- OpenCL will be replaced in the future. New solutions have been looked
  up.
- User support is currently done on through the mailing list and
  internally managed on trac. It can  be migrated  to git issues for
more transparency 

## Funding

- SINE2020 currently supports 0.5person
- We should look for new funding oportunities
- Data/model validation can be a potential student project
- Actual work commitment should be identified to recognize what are
  resources to keep project running
- Facilities should be involved in supporting core functionalities by
  providing man power. 

## New/core functionalities
- Real-time analysis is a ESS/DMSC milestone in 2019 and should  be
  moved forward on the map
