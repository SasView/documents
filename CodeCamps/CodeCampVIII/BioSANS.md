# BioSANS discussion at Code Camp VII

The main focus of this dicussion was to identify what functionalities of
SasView we can currently support for Biological community and how this
can be extended in the future

## Existing functionalities
- Generic scattering calculator can be used to calculate intensity from
  PDB files. It is quite slow though and alternative solutions may need
to be implemented. Spherical harmonics or golden vector are potential
solutions
- Generic scattering calculator should be moved to perspective, which
  will open up for more fucntionalities, e.g. multiple data files and
PDB models 
- Extensive testing will have to be performed on these tools
- P(r) perspective
## New functionalities
- Bead models generator using freesas
- Volume fraction determination tool, simple using SVD and more
  sophisticated (Bayesian based)

## Funding/support
- BioSANS and integration of open source software may be a topic of
  regional SasView meeting
