# Beta approximation discussion at the Code Camp VII

- GUI beta approximation branches will be merged with ESS_GUI as soon as
  possible 
- Once merge is done, a separate Jenkins build running ESS_GUI with
  sasmodels_betaapprox will be set up to monitor the progress and
facilite merge in the future.
- Hopefully beta approximation will be available before user meeting at
  SAS2018
