# McSAS integration discussed at the Code Camp VII

There are a few different ways to incorporate McSAS into SasView. This
can be done gradually:
- first, by adding McSAS as optimizer to existing Fit Algorithms
- then moving fit algorithm to fit options tab

Polydispersity function ploting is a separate task that has been
adressed at this code camp
