# SESANS
The fitting of SESANS data was incorporated into SasView following
excellent work by Jurrian Bakker, Wim Bouwman & Steven Parnell at
Code Camps III & IV. Initially, this functionality was only
available using the scripting interface in SasView and required
the installation of a 'developer setup'. It is this which is
described in the accompanying file SESANSinSASVIEW.pdf. This file
has been distributed with Sasmodels documentation (and thereby
SasView documentation) ever since.

However, from SasView v4.1.1 (July 2017) the fitting of SESANS data
was fully integrated into the SasView FitPage and the instructions
in the accompanying file became obsolete. Unfortunately, the
SasView fitting documentation never got updated!

As of October 2021, the accompanying file has been moved to the
documents repository for posterity, ahead of a clean-up of the
SESANS documentation in the sasmodels repository.
