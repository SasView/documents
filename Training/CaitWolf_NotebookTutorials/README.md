# CaitWolf_NotebookTutorials

This directory contains tutorials for scripting with SasView/sasmodels in a Jupyter notebook format. They were designed to run on Google Colab: save the file to a Google Drive location and open with Google Colab. All required packages will be installed on-the-fly as part of the tutorial. The notebooks can also be run locally via Jupyter if a Python environment with the required dependencies are installed.

Where available, both instructor and student versions of the notebooks are provided.
