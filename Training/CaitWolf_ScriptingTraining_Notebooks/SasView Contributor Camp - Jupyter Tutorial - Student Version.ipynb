It includes over 70 built-in models, the ability to apply polydispersity and resolution, fitting with your custom models and many more scattering analysis tools.\n","\n","The software pacakge is actually broken up into multiple github repositories including [sasview](https://github.com/SasView/sasview), [sasmodels](https://github.com/SasView/sasmodels), and [sasdata](https://github.com/SasView/sasdata). The sasview library includes code for the GUI while the sasmodels library includes code for all the models, polydispersity, and resolution calculations. It also interfaces with [bumps](https://github.com/bumps), a data fitting library. Sasdata handles the import and export of small-angle scattering data, both in standard data formats from multiple facilities as well as more general file formats (e.g., txt or csv).\n","\n","The sasmodels and bumps libraries can be imported and used directly into Python scripts, enabling the development of custom and reproducible analysis procedures for large amounts of scattering data.
